# Toronto Bike Share Visualizer

## Why

> Disclaimer: Obviously the details and functionality of this extension may change over time, but it solves a need in the now, rather than hoping for better UX on BikeShares end.

It all started when I wanted to just get an overview/some simple stats on my own Bike Share [activity](https://members.bikesharetoronto.com/overview). However, the site just has a list of your rides, with a quite annoying process of grabbing it.

Within _any_ custom time window, the site only displays the last `50` entries (at most). Sadly, it has no pagination ðŸ¤¦.

So what I really needed to achieve as a baseline, was a way to grab all of my data. I figured that within 15 day chunks, `50` rides would be reasonable, and to get all my rides I'd just need to decrement by said chunks until I reach the "Bikeshare epoch", which is around 2011 (though 2014 is when it became [Bikeshare Toronto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bike_Share_Toronto). However I can't say if there was a data migration between those times, so I am keeping it there to be safe.
